            I love sunsets. I love how the sky turn into a canvas of colors, and how the sun slowly disappears below the horizon.
            I love how the world seems to slow down during that time, and how everything feels more peaceful. The hill you've shown
            me is a great spot to watch the sunset. It felt peaceful when you brought me there, away from the noise and chaos of the
            city. It was one of those moments where words weren't necessary, and we just enjoyed the beauty of the sky together. The
            challenge this time is if I can handle myself when I pass by your house. I don't know what would I feel when I see you by
            the window, and I was hoping you would go out and do some errands or something. Anyway, I just want to watch the sunset
            so I travelled quick after my shift. I arrived in Sandigan just in time, and I walked from the school to the hill. I
            stopped by the store in front of your home to buy water, while subtly looking at your window. I guess you were laying on
            the couch, bed-rotting. I continued walking until I reached the hill, and sat down at our spot. I loved the breeze and the
            quiet.
