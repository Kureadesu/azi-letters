          <p>
            I went to BGC. I was supposed to drink, but rather spend money on beer, I decided to walk around BGC for a while.
            The last time I went there was our first monthsary, and your last day of internship. To be honest, I've been thinking
            of going back to BGC for a while now, but I was scared. I was scared of the memories that would come back, 
            and the emotions that would come with it. But I also knew that I can face those memories and emotions and handle them.
            I made sure I was grounded before I went there. After my shift, I went ahead to BGC through Guadalupe 'cause you know,
            there's always heavy traffic in Forbes Park. I also documented everything.
          </p>

          <p>
            I went to Market Market first, where we had our photoshoot. As I stepped out of the elevator, I immediately felt the
            nostalgia. I remembered how we were so excited to have our photoshoot there, and how we were so nervous about it. I
            remembered how we were so happy to be there, and how we were so proud of the photos we took. I got teary-eyed walking
            to the photobooth, and I couldn't help but smile at the same time. I was happy to be there, but I was also sad that
            you weren't there with me. I stayed there for a while before I decided to go to the next spot. 
          </p>

          <p>
            I passed through high street remembering how we used to walk around here. Then I stopped by the Burgos Circle, and 
            sat there for a while. I
            thought I would crash out there; surprisingly, I didn't. I just sat there, and let the memories wash over me.
            I remembered waiting here for you to finish your shift. It kinda felt heavy that I'm near Bonifacio, knowing that I
            won't be meeting you there anymore.
          </p>

          <p>
            Now I'm here. I stood by the front entrance. It felt like I was waiting for you to come out, 
            but I knew you won't be coming out anymore. The wave of emotions hit me. I missed you, and I let myself feel that. I smiled looking back at
            the memories we had here. Walking long distances didn't tire me 'cause I knew I'd be with you. Waiting and standing wasn't a problem whenever
            I'm with you. Ditching my last class to be with you was never a problem (I still aced that class, by the way). 
            It felt weird and peaceful that I'm strolling here alone. <br><i>I won't deny that what I did was hard, but healing. This is
            how I re-learn to be with myself.</i>
