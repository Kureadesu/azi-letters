          <p>
            Dear Azi, today I start this collection of letters to you. There's so much I want to say, 
            so many thoughts that swirl in my mind when I think of you. This feels like the right way 
            to capture everything—to put words to feelings that are sometimes too big for conversation.
          </p>

          <p>
            I've been thinking about what it means to really know someone. Not just the surface things—the 
            favorite songs, the go-to coffee order, the stories they tell at parties. But the deeper currents. 
            The way your voice changes when you're tired. The specific way you laugh when something catches 
            you off guard. The look in your eyes when you're processing something difficult.
          </p>

          <p>
            These are the things I carry with me. These are the details that matter. In writing them down, 
            I'm creating a map of us—a way to remember not just the big moments, but all the small, quiet 
            ones that make up a life shared, even in fragments.
          </p>

          <p>
            I don't know where this collection will lead or how many letters there will be. But I know that 
            each one will be honest. Each one will be for you. And each one will be a small act of preservation—
            keeping alive the things that matter most.
          </p>

          <p>
            This is just the beginning. There's so much more to say.
          </p>

          <p style="text-align: right; font-style: italic; margin-top: 3rem;">
            Always yours,<br>
            Eli.
